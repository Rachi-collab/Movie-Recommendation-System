# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a simple machine learning-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user. It uses content-based filtering, where the recommendations are made based on movie metadata such as title, genre, and overview.

The system processes the dataset using TF-IDF Vectorization and calculates cosine similarity between movies to identify the closest matches. The application is built using Python and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
Recommend top 5 similar movies
Based on content similarity (no user history needed)
Easy-to-use web interface

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Streamlit for UI
NLTK for text preprocessing
